    "1. Import the following libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",

    "   from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\n",
    "   from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor\n",
    "   from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostRegressor\n",

    "   All subsequent model selection will be carried out with the train set.\n",

    "3. We are interested in comparing 3 classes of ML algorithms here:\n",
    "   - `RandomForestRegressor`\n",
    "   - `AdaBoostRegressor`\n",
    "   - `GradientBoostingRegressor`\n",
    "\n",
    "   Boosted decision trees (`AdaBoost`, `GradientBoosting` & others)\n",
    "   have been shown empirically to outperform `RandomForest` on average in terms\n",

    "   As a starting point, below are instantiations of the 3 classes of\n",
    "   algorithms. I have given you a set of hyperparameters for each\n",

    "   **Note:**\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Using `cross_val_score` in `sklearn`, define a function that \n",

    "5. Define a new instance of `GradientBoostingRegressor` with the exact same\n",

    "    What do you notice?\n",
    "\n",
    "6. We're going to make a plot to help us understand the impact of the learning rate\n",

    "   ![stage_score_plot](images/stage_score_plot.png)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   In order to get the labels for the plot, you can use `model.__class__.__name__` to get the model name and `model.learning_rate` to get the learning rate.\n",

    "\n",
    "   Since you are comparing two models and we're showing both the training and\n",
