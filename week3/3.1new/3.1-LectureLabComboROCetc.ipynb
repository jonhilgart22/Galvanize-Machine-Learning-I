    "# Evaluation Metrics for Classifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two reasons why you might want to evaluate the performance of a classifier.  One is that you need to characterize performance as part of optimizing model parameters (also known as \"training\" the model).  The other is that you need to guage the performance of a classifier in terms of the objectives of the problem you're trying to solve.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Videos on classifier metrics\n",
    "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-PwDwaQQpY - ROC  \n",
    "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAl6eAyP-yo  - AUC  \n",
    "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrr4eu29uww - Confusion matrix 1/2  \n",
    "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1lUKcbMZtA - Confusion matrix 2/2  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q\n",
    "Would the same method of performance evaluation work for both of these objectives?  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "* Given two ROC curves, pick the best curve/threshold for the problem at hand\n",
    "* When would you use F_beta vs. AUC\n",
    "* State one reason why the Youden index is useful and one reason it can be misleading\n",
    "* __Exercise (next week):__ Construct a Profit curve to evaluate the precision/recall trade-off\n",
    "\n",
    "## Review \n",
    "\n",
    "A classification problem is when we're trying to predict a discrete (categorical) outcome. We'll start with binary classification (i.e., yes/no questions).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some example questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Does a patient have cancer?\n",
    "* Will a team win the next game?\n",
    "* Will the customer buy my product?\n",
    "* Will I get the loan?\n",
    "\n",
    "In binary classification, we assign labels of 0 and 1 to our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by looking at an example. We're going to be using some NFL data. The x axis is the number of touchdowns scored by team over a season and the y axis is whether they lost or won the game indicated by a value of 0 or 1 respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "![NFL data](images/nfl.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how do we predict whether we have a win or a loss if we are given a score? Note that we are going to be predicting values between 0 and 1. Close to 0 means we're sure it's in class 0, close to 1 means we're sure it's in class 1, and closer to 0.5 means we don't know.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we use linear regression, we will certainly do better than randomly guessing, but it doesn't accurately represent the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "![NFL linear regression](images/linefit.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "So clearly a line is not the best way to model this data. So we need to find a better curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Measuring success \n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we measure how well our model does? Just like with regression, we need to split the data in a training set and a test set and measure our success based on how well it does on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accuracy\n",
    "The simplest measure is **accuracy**. This is the number of correct predictions over the total number of predictions. It's the percent you predicted correctly. In `sklearn`, this is what the `score` method calculates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shortcomings of Accuracy\n",
    "Accuracy is often a good first glance measure, but it has many shortcomings. If the classes are unbalanced, accuracy will not measure how well you did at predicting. Say you are trying to predict whether or not an email is spam. Only 2% of emails are in fact spam emails. You could get 98% accuracy by always predicting not spam. This is a great accuracy but a horrible model!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Confusion Matrix\n",
    "We can get a better picture our model but looking at the confusion matrix. We get the following four metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **True Positives (TP)**: Correct positive predictions\n",
    "* **False Positives (FP)**: Incorrect positive predictions (false alarm)\n",
    "* **True Negatives (TN)**: Correct negative predictions\n",
    "* **False Negatives (FN)**: Incorrect negative predictions (a miss)\n",
    "\n",
    "|            | Predicted Yes  | Predicted No   |\n",
    "| ---------- | -------------- | -------------- |\n",
    "| Actual Yes | True positive  | False negative |\n",
    "| Actual No  | False positive | True negative  |\n",
    "\n",
    "With logistic regression, we can visualize it as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![logistic confusion matrix](images/logistic.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Precision, Recall and F1\n",
    "\n",
    "![](http://i.stack.imgur.com/ysM0Z.png)\n",
    "Instead of accuracy, there are some other scores we can calculate:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Precision**: A measure of how good your positive predictions are\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Precison = TP / (TP + FP)\n",
    "             = TP / (predicted yes)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "* **Recall**: A measure of how well you predict positive cases. Aka *sensitivity*.\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Recall = TP / (TP + FN) \n",
    "           = TP / (actual yes)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "* **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of Precision and Recall\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    F1 = 2 / (1/Precision + 1/Recall)\n",
    "       = 2 * Precision * Recall / (Precision + Recall)\n",
    "       = 2TP / (2TP + FN + FP)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy can also be written in this notation:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + FP + TN + FN)\n",
