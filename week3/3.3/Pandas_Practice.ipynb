    "As a data scientist, being able to manipulate data and pull out meaningful information from all types of data will be extremely important. Knowing the diffferent ways data is stored, and how to structure that data will also be a top priority. Today, I will give you an overview of what things you NEED to know, in order to be a data scientist. "

    "1. Read in the data from here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/auto-mpg/auto-mpg.data. Notice the 'nan' values are question marks. Fill the question marks wiht the 'nan' string, but do this in one line. Everything we do today should be accomplished in a single line. Make sure to replace the '?' with NaN values. I will give you a list of the column names. Here are the column names: \n",

    "    1. mpg:           continuous\n",
    "    2. cylinders:     multi-valued discrete\n",

    "    5. weight:        continuous\n",

    "5. Now create a column called 'horsepower_sqrt' column which is the square root of the horsepower.\n",

    "11. Bin the acceleration into 4 groups, [(7 - 12), (12 - 16), (16 - 20),(20 - 25)] and name this column 'accel_bins'. What is the mean mpg for each bin?\n",
    "\n",

    "13. Dummify the column containing (7, 12] and (12, 16]. Only keep (7, 12] and MERGE it to the DataFrame. We don't need (12, 16] since it is extra information. \n",
