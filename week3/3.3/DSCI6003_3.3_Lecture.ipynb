    "# Validation vs. Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "These two concepts are often entangled in the mind of an inexperienced investigator. When we speak of models in machine learning, **evaluation** refers to the use of established metrics or measurements to characterize the expected future performance of a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Validation** has a specific scientific meaning. It refers to the verification of a prediction using other methods of observation(within established criteria of acceptance). For example if we obtain a result with one experiment, we must verify our conclusion of that experiment with other experiments. In order to make sure that our result is **valid** the additional studies on this predicition must be a representative sample of potential observers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In traditional science this is done with the process of **peer review.** Historically, scientists would publish results in **letters,** and other scientists of similar skill would repeat these experiments. Eventually the community would come to a consensus, and these final validated conclusions would be printed as an **article**. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of validation: cross-validation, wherein the same experiment (or method or model) is repeated different times, and orthogonal validation, where an entirely different technique capable of obtaining approximately the same conclusion is used and compared against the first experiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, we always use **cross-validation every time a new model is constructed** in order to verify the model's consistency and performance over a fixed set of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Orthogonal validation** should be used if you are not certain about results or are using a new classifier not yet tested. The word \"orthogonal\" suggests that the method being used is entirely different from the original. [Benchmark data sets and standard classifiers](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html) are typiclly used to perform comparison, with an appropriate visualization technique. We teach you most of the standard classfiers in this class. When you implement your own classifier, you can use orthogonal methods\n",

    "*We use cross validation as a means to get a sense of the error. Our final model will be built on all of the data so that we can have the best model possible.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Validation Set\n",
    "\n",
    "A validation (or hold out) set is a random sample of our data that we reserve for testing. We don't use this part of our data for building our model, just for assessing how well it did.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A typical breakdown is:\n",
    "    - 80% of our data in the training set (which we use the build the model)\n",
    "    - 20% of our data in the test set (which we use to evaluate the model)\n",
    "* Make sure that you randomize your data! It's really dangerous to pick the first 80% of the data to train and the last 20% to test since data is often sorted by a feature or the target! It would cause trouble if all the expensive houses were in your test set and never in the training set!\n",
    "* Concerns:\n",
    "    - *Variable:* Depending what random sample we get, we will get different values\n",
    "    - *Underestimating:* We are actually underestimating a little bit since we testing a model built on just 80% of the dataset instead of the whole 100%.\n",

    "be the training set. In the next iteration, another group will be the test set,\n",
    "and the rest will be the training set. The process repeats for k iterations (k-fold).\n",
    "In each fold, a metric for accuracy will be calculated and\n",
