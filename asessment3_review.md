# 6003 Assessment 3

* Time: 60 minutes
* Closed book
* Individual

There are 22 questions that cover these topics:

* ROC/Profit Curve
* Bagging
* Boosting
* K-Means/PAM
* Clustering Evaluation
* Expectation Maximization and GMM
* Proximity Clustering

Here is a review of those two weeks of the course to prepare for the skills test.

## ROC/Profit Curves
