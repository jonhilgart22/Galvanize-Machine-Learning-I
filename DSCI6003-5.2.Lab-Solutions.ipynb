    "from sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split\n",

    "### A. Implement *Tree Bagging*\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging, or *bootstrap aggregating*, is taking several random samples *with replacement* from the data set and building a model for each sample. Each of these models gets a vote on the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling with replacement means that we can repeat data points. In the basic random forest, we will always use a sample size that is the same as the size of the original data set. Many data points will not be included in each sample and many will be repeated.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implement the `build_forest` method. For right now, we will be ignoring the `num_features` parameter. Here is the pseudocode:\n",
    "\n",
    "      Repeat num_trees times:\n",
    "          Create a random sample of the data with replacement\n",
    "          Build a decision tree with that sample\n",
    "      Return the list of the decision trees created\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Implement random feature selection\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Modify the `DecisionTree` class so that it takes an additional parameter: `num_features`. This is the number of features to consider at each node in choosing the best split. Which features to consider is randomly chosen at each node. You will need to modify the `__init__`, method to take a `num_features` parameter. In `_choose_split_index`, you should randomly select `num_features` of the potential features to consider. Only calculate and compare the features that were randomly chosen, so that the feature you choose is one of the randomly chosen features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Modify `build_forest` in your `RandomForest` class to pass the `num_features` parameter to the Decision Trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Implement classification and scoring\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the `predict` method, you should have each Decision Tree classify each data point. Choose the label with the majority of trees. Break ties by choosing one of the labels arbitrarily.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In the `score` method, you should first classify the data points and count the percent of them which match the given labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Try a bigger data set\n",
    "\n",
    "You won't be able to get great results cross validating with the play golf data set since it's so small. In the data folder, there's a dataset called 'congressional_voting.csv'. This contains congressman, how they voted on different issues and their party.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Out-of-bag error is a clever way of validating your model by testing individual trees based on samples that weren't including in their training set. It is described in the lecture notes, [Applied Data Science](http://columbia-applied-data-science.github.io/appdatasci.pdf) (9.4.3) and [Breiman's notes](http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/RandomForests/cc_home.htm#ooberr).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Feature importance is a way of determining which features contribute the most to being able to predict the result. It is discussed in the lecture notes and [Breiman's notes](http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/RandomForests/cc_home.htm#varimp). You can compare what features you get with Breiman's method vs [sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#feature-importance-evaluation)."
