    "#### The Scientific Method\n",
    "\n",
    "You should, as a data *scientist*, know and recite the scientific method by heart. The following below pattern is the standard description of the method:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Question: All scientific progress begins with a question about the natural world. Such as: \"How many Twitter users are connected by 3 or fewer degrees of separation in real life?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Hypothesis: You must make a hypothesis regarding the question. The hypothesis is *always based on empirical observation*. In our example, we must have made some exploratory charts or documents that lead to a starting point. For example, we make a study of twitter user cross-tweeting and after initial calculations it appears that 30% of the users we studied used familiar terminology with each other. Oftentimes, we refine the Question itself during the hypothesis stage, so that these two feed back upon each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Prediction: (This is the most difficult part): Based on your hypothesis, you need to make a refined and detailed and *testable* forward prediction (test set) of behavior of the system. It **cannot be** a posteriori description of the data. For example, you cannot look at past data (training set) and create an explanation for the observation *based on the past data*. This is called \"rationalization,\" broadly, and more specifically, will fall into one of several [formal fallacies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_fallacy). You should become familiar with rhetoric, logical argument and fallacies during your time here. --- In our example, let's say that we predict that 1/2 of all people that use familiar twitter terminology actually know each other in real life. This means we predict that approximately 15% of new users will know each other in real life. (typically we will attach confidence intervals to this estimate)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Experiment: You design a new experiment that tests your prediction. It needs to be falsifiable, and will fall within a simple True/False boolean description of the outcome. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Conclusion: The conclusion of the experiment. Based upon the conclusion, we commonly refine our Hypothesis and Question and repeat.\n",
    "\n",
    "### QUIZ:\n",
    "\n",
    "Design an experiment for part 4 of the above cycle. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is rarely the way it really works, but it's a nice [approximation](http://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/howscienceworks_02). \n"

    "## Graphs and Unions\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we continue with modern machine learning, it is useful to study basic computer science and the implementation of modern \"intelligent\" algorithms used to solve relatively common classes of problems. We will develop the notion of graphs as clear and natural representations of information. The management and access of this information is reducible to a simple matter of searching this structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graphs and Dynamic Connectivity\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs are simply a way of describing relationships amongst objects in terms of nodes and edges. Graphs can be directional, nondirectional, cyclical or acyclical. \n",
    "\n",
    "Associations amongst objects within graphs are determined by the relationships amongst the data itself. Correctly modeling the problem with a graph requires the correct use of the node-edge representation. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dynamic Connectivity\n",
    "\n",
    "One attribute of graphical representations of data that frequently arises during the use of algorithms to process it is the need for **dynamic connectivity**, that is, node-edge relationships that are allowed to change during the process of the algorithm. Thus, dynamic connectivity needs to be represented by a data structure that dynamically maintains information about the connected components of a graph. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three basic modes of dynamic connectivity:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Edges are only added to the graph (this can be called incremental connectivity)\n",
    "* Edges are only deleted from the graph (this can be called decremental connectivity)\n",
    "* Edges can be either added or deleted (this can be called fully dynamic connectivity)\n",
    "\n",
    "Groups of connected nodes are called \"components\"\n",
    "\n",
    "![uf](./images/uf1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "After edges are added or deleted, the structure used (can come in several forms) should adapt itself so as to proved the most efficient representation of the data, **always with an eye on finding any (shortest) possible path between two nodes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we look to find the path between p and q in the below figure:\n",
    "\n",
    "![connectivity](./images/connectivity_uf.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, in the formulation of this problem, we have developed three design parameters (invariants) for dynamic connectivity structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 Clarity\n",
    "2) Efficiency\n",
    "3) Path Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Applications for such a structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pixels in a photo\n",
    "* Computers in a network\n",
    "* Transistors in computer chips\n",
    "* Friends in a social network\n",
    "* many more\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementing Quick Union\n",
    "\n",
    "We can represent the structure of the union-find in terms of an array, called \"id\". The elements p and q are connected iff they have the same id number.\n",
    "\n",
    "{0, 1, 1, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 8, 8}\n",
    "\n",
    "(0, 5, 6) are a component, (1, 2, 7) are a component, (3, 4, 8, 9) are a component\n",
    "\n",
    "find: determine if p and q have the same id\n",
    "\n",
    "union: connect p and q by the same id - this is complex, due to the fact that many indices can change.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the find we can find elements within the structure can be found linearly, but the union between p and q is far too complex and wasteful to do it the same way. Instead, we can use a short cut by changing all entries with id[p] to id[q]. This cuts down the need to separately loop through every element, with at most 2N+2 lookups.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    def connected(p, q):\n",
    "        # access in O(N) time\n",
    "        if id[p] == id[q]:\n",
    "            return True\n",
    "        return False\n",
    "\n",
    "    def union(p, q):\n",
    "        idp = id[p]\n",
    "        idq = id[q]\n",
    "        for i in xrange(N):\n",
    "            if id[i] == idp:\n",
    "                id[i] = idq\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## QUIZ:\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the maximum number of entries that can change from one union operation?\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you have to execute N union commands on N objects, the union runs in $O(N^2)$ and becomes rather inefficient to crawl through if we have to look at every union when we want to find something. How can we overcome this problem? We can use the fact that we already have unexploited efficiency built into the graph data structure. Using the same data structure, we now think of the array as represeting a set of trees, called a **forest**. Because each root already knows its own parent root, all the way up to and including itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " Now in order to find if p and q are connected, we check to see if they have the same root\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore in order to find a node, we can loop through the **pointers** to find the correct. In python, everything is a pointer, so we actually recurse through the name assignments in the following \"lazy\" way:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def connected(p, q):\n",
    "        i = find_root(p)\n",
    "        j = find_root(q)        \n",
    "        if i == j:\n",
    "            return True\n",
    "        return False\n",
    "\n",
    "    def find_root(p)\n",
    "        i = index_of(p)\n",
    "        while i != id[i]:\n",
    "            id[i] = id[id[i]]   # Path compression using halving.\n",
    "            i = id[i]\n",
    "        return i\n",
    "\n",
    "    def quick_union(p, q):\n",
    "        i = find_root(p)\n",
    "        j = find_root(q)\n",
    "        if i!=j:\n",
    "            id[i] = j\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This now accesses the array in $O(N)$ time, much more efficiently. In python, it ususally hurts you to try to implement complex ADS like these, and so it's best to try to use a built in data structure for your needs.\n",
