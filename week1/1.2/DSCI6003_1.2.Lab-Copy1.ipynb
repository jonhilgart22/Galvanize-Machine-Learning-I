    "Dijkstra's algorithm is a classic BFS (Breadth First Search) type algorithm designed to solve the dynamic connectivity problem in the case where the graph in question has edge lengths and we seek to find the **shortest path possible** between two nodes. There are dozens of variants of BFS and many of the simplest ones are *rather common 2nd round interview questions for data scientists*\n",

    "Dijkstra's algorithm can be written in many ways. Today you are to learn the algorithm inside and out by completing the below code stub. Here the graph is given to the algorithm as a dictionary, and the algorithm keeps track of members of the support set separately, as it recurses over the shortest nodes. Dijkstra's algorithm can also be written with *for* loops rather than recursion. Virtually all recursive algorithms can be rewritten in terms of for loops. As difficult as recursion is to understand, however, it is often a shortcut when compared to the daunting task of trying to replicate recursion. "
