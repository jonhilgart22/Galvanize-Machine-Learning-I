    "## Dynamic Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Programming, along with Linear Programming, is one of the most powerful and general programming techniques known today. Generality comes at some cost of additional complexity and performance. Although it is not terribly likeley that you will be asked to directly implement one of these methods in an analyst role, it is increasingly likely that the skills and knowledge attained from the study of these methods will later be useful when you are forced to tackle an unknown problem. Anyone who wishes to later work on an algorithms or engineering team should study both and consider mastering one of these two realms. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: * The wikipedia page on dynamic programming comes with a warning attached.  It is a little garbled.   [overgrown wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming). Be a little wary about what you use from it.  You'll find an interesting historical detail.  In an extended quote from Richard Bellman, the inventor explains where the terminology \"dynamic programming\" came from.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\"...it's impossible to use the word dynamic in a pejorative sense. Try thinking of some combination that will possibly give it a pejorative meaning. It's impossible. Thus, I thought dynamic programming was a good name. It was something not even a Congressman could object to. So I used it as an umbrella for my activities.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning has caused a resurgence of interest and research in dynamic programming.  Several of popular techniques for RL are based on dynamic programming.  Here's a set of slides from Dimitri Bertsekas. http://athenasc.com/NDP_Review.pdf   These slides review the use of neural nets to approximate some of the functions required for DP.  The examples we'll look at below are simple enough that tables will work.  Game playing (atari or go) requires more substantial functions requiring other forms of parametric approximation (piecewise linear approximations or neural nets, for example).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic programming is a relatively profound subfield of computer programming [all by itself](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=dynamic+programming). It is a way of solving complex problems where we must find a global optimum. DP breaks down problems into smaller problems (called subproblems) using **recursion**, and then storing that solution in a table or structure of some sort, called **memoization**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the illustrative problem of generating Fibonacci sequences the following youtube video will give a good intuitive feel.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CAbRVYAWg\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the distinction between household variety recursion, memoization and DP, let's look at the problem of generating Fibonacci numbers.  The basic Fibonacci sequence satisfies:\n",
    "\n",
    "$F_{n} = F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}$  \n",
    "\n",
    "where the first two values are defined as 1:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$F_{0} = F_{1} = 1$  \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus we have 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377 and so on.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the Fibonacci sequence is defined as a recursion it fits easily into a recursive function definition.  You'll see that the recursion is terribly slow.  You'll see a couple of approaches for improving the compute times.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll look at three approaches to calculating this sequence, garden variety recursion, memoization and dynamic programming.  Let's look at each of these in sequence and estimate the compute costs of each.  For the illustrative problem of generating Fibonacci sequences the following youtube video will give a good intuitive feel. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0CAbRVYAWg\n",

    "    def fib(n):  \n",
    "       if n < 3: f = 1  \n",
    "       else: f = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)  \n",
    "       return f  \n",
    "\n",
    "What is the order complexity for this computation?  To get an idea, suppose that the time to compute then nth number is T(n).  What recursion does T(n) satisfy?  Draw out a tree to illustrate the dependencies.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Memoization\n",
    "The replicated dependencies that the dependency tree illustrated can be eliminated by memo-izing values of fib(n) as they are generated.  That eliminates the duplicate computations.  For this approach start with an empty dictionary that you'll use to store each Fibonacci number as you generate it.  Subsequent calls just look up the answer in the dictionary.  \n",

    "\n",
    "You can add memoization to any recursive algorithm.  If the natural recurssion would result in multiple evaluations for the same argument, then it will save some compute time.  What is the compute complexity for this approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Dynamic programming\n",
    "Dynamic programming has a memoization component, but it takes a somewhat different approach which may not look very dramatic in this Fibonnaci sequence problem but which will make a big difference as the problems get more complicated.  \n",
    "\n",
    "DP works on the problem starting from the other end and conquering small sub-problems and then aggregating them up into the final result.  It's called bottom-up versus the top-down recursions that we looked at above.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Writing fibonacci:\n",
    "```\n",
    "def fib(n):  \n",
    "   if n <= 2: return 1  \n",
    "   s_0 = 1  \n",
    "   s_1 = 1  \n",
    "   ctr = 1  \n",
    "   while ctr < n:  \n",
    "      f = s_0 + s_1  \n",
    "      s_0 = s_1  \n",
    "      s_1 = f  \n",
    "      ctr+=1  \n",
    "   return f\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"memoizing\" in this version is truncated relative to example 2.  In example 2 you need to build a dictionary to hold all the intermediate values of the fib().  In the bottom up, DP approach only the last two values are needed and there's no sense in keeping the other ones, so the \"memo\" is smaller.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is of course quite ugly, and so we can write the recurrence relationship directly as the algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def fibonacci(n):\n",
    "        if n == 0:\n",
    "            return 0\n",

    "        else:\n",
    "            return fibonacci(n-1)+fibonacci(n-2)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this is not the most effective method of performing the calculation. For example if you try to compute fibonacci(1000) with this code, you will see that it is indeed quite slow. \n",
