    "The nature of the items to be sorted by the list can vary, for example, alphanumeric characters, integers or floating point values. We might also consider things such as vectors and geometric objects. In any of these cases, there must be a way of effectively comparing two items. For integers and floating values, comparisons are easily made using the standard comparison operations ( <, >, <=, >=, ==, != ), guaranteed to work by the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. Alphanumeric characters are ordered naturally in the way that they are taught (i.e. a:1, b: 2, c: 3, etc.). For other objects, such as vectors or alphabet characters, we have to\n",

    "Charting [sorting algorithms](http://www.sorting-algorithms.com/) is important to understanding them. It is important that you learn to work out drawing sorting charts by hand. \n",

    "1) Efficient - minimizes search complexity\n",

    "\n",
    "The first algorithm that you will learn is [selection sort](http://www.sorting-algorithms.com/selection-sort). Selection sort is the most obvious and slowest possible method of sorting. It works by going through the array, rank-by-rank, and exchanging the item currently in that rank with the next smallest item. It only looks at items after the current rank, not before. The pseudocode is given below:\n",

    "The problem with selection sort is its performance. It doesn't adapt well to partially ordered arrays, and requires a large number of operations, $N$ operations for the rank searching in the index $i$ and $N$ operations for the lookahead. This means that there are always $N \\times N$ array accesses, and thus the algorithm always runs in $O(N^2)$ time. However, it has the property of minimizing the number of required swaps, so selection sort might be used in extreme cases where swap cost is very high (larger than $O(N^2)$)."
