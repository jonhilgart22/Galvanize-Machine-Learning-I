X is negative definite if -X is positive definite.  X is positive semi-definite if $v^TXv\\, \\geq\\,0 \\,\\forall v\\ne0$.  Sometimes you will see notation $X\\, >\\, 0$ with X a matrix.  That is a common shorthand for saying that X is positive definite.  "

    "Symmetric matrices have a relatively simple structure that can sometimes be useful for doing calculations and for visualizing the properties and effects of operations and equations.  The baasic notion is that by changing your coordinate frame you can view a symmetric matrix as being diagonal.  Multiplication by a diagonal matrix is much easier to contemplate than by a more general matrix.  In mathematical terms every square symmetric matrix matrix X can be decomposed as follows $X\\, =\\, U^T\\Lambda U$ where U and $\\Lambda$ square and the same dimension as X, U is orthogonal and $\\Lambda$ is diagonal with the eigenvalues of X along the diagonal.  \n",
