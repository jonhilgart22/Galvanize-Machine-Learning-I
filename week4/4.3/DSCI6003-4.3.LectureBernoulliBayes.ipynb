    "### Why is Naive Bayes \"Naive?\"\n",
    "1. Assumes that all conditional distributions $P(x_{i}|c_{k})$ are independent. Please see chain rule.\n",
    "2. We assume that we have a perfect sample of the input distributions.\n",
    "3. We ignore the effects of the joint.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A slightly more precise description of Multinomial NB:\n",
    "\n",
    "The total likelihood of observing a given histogram (distribution) is the joint probability of every bin for a given event $x_i$ found $n_i$ times in the histogram:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(C_{k}|{\\bf{x}}) = \\dfrac{(\\sum_{i}n_{i})!}{\\prod_{i}n_{i}!}\\prod_{i}P(x_{i}|C_{k})^{n_i}P(C_{k})$\n",
    "\n",
    "To use it as a NB maximum-likelihood method, we just dump the whole coefficient in front and take the log-likelihood:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(C_{k}|{\\bf{x}}) = log(P(C_{k})) + \\sum_{i}n_{i}log(P(x_{i}|C_{k}))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this is another linear equation:\n",
    "\n",

    "## Inference and Bayesian Updating\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the way we have formulated Naive Bayes assumes that we have a perfectly complete sample, meaning that we do not update our prior beliefs. What does it mean if we think that new data (our test data) should affect our predictions? This falls within the realm of *bayesian updating*. The mathematics of bayesian updating is described directly from Bayes' law, and only requires that we can recognize it and execute it where needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that a process generates a set of observations (events) $E_{m}$ and that we have a set of **models** $M_{k}$ describing this process. Each model is represented (defined) by the conditional probability tables $P(E_{m}|M_{k})$ and our **belief that this model is correct** is represented by the prior $P(M_{k})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before** the first inference step, the prior distribution of our set of models $M_{k}$, $\\{P(M_m)\\}$ is a set of initial prior probabilities, obtained perhaps from expert knowledge. These must sum to 1, but are **otherwise arbitrary.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**After** each inference step $t+1$, we update the conditional probability tables $P(E_{m}|M_{k})$ by *multiplying them by our current belief in that model* $P(M_{k,t+1})$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(M_{k,t+1}|E_{m,t+1}) = \\dfrac{P(E_{m,t}|M_{k,t})}{\\sum_{k=0}^{K}P(E_{m,t}|M_{k,t})}\\ P(M_{k,t+1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that the denominator is simply a normalization factor to ensure that we have a distribution over each of the $K$ models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, so how do we go about getting this number $P(M_{k,t+1})$? Precisely, it is this prior that is allowed to change with respect to each new event $E_{m,t+1}$. We get this update from the way we formulate the problem. After multiplication by the proper likelihood (comes from a table worked out beforehand), the posterior becomes a new prior.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is called **Bayesian updating.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Although obtaining the update formula can be very complex indeed, but doesn't need to be for you to understand how it works conceptually."

    "### Example 1: Cookies in Bowls\n",
    "\n",
    "We have two bowls with cookies in them. One bowl (B1) has 5 chocolate chip cookies and 15 plain cookies in it, while the other bowl (B2) has 10 of each. We randomly draw a cookie from one of the bowls and we see that it is a plain cookie. How likely is it that the cookie came from the first bowl? \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Formulation: \n",
    "\n",
    "We seek $P(B1|plain)$. Our hypothesis priors on the bowls before pulling cookies are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(B1) == P(B2) == 0.5$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We also have knowledge beforehand that the likelihood of it being a plain cookie, given bowl 1 is $$P(plain|B1) = \\dfrac{15}{20} = \\dfrac{3}{4} = 0.75$$\n",
    "and the likelihood of it being a chocolate cookie given bowl 1 is $$P(choc|B1) = \\dfrac{5}{20} = \\dfrac{1}{4} = =0.25$$\n",
    "Conversely, $$P(choc|B2) = P(plain|B2) = \\dfrac{1}{2} = 0.5$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Bayes' Law upon the first draw $t=1$: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$P_{t=1}(B1|plain) = \\dfrac{\\dfrac{3}{4} \\times \\dfrac{1}{2}}{\\dfrac{3}{4} \\times \\dfrac{1}{2}+\\dfrac{1}{2} \\times \\dfrac{1}{2}} = \\dfrac{\\dfrac{3}{8}}{\\dfrac{5}{8}}  = \\dfrac{3}{5} = 0.6$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So now our model that $B1$ is the bowl from which we are pulling cookies becomes this value! Thus $P(B1) = 0.6$ This is our belief that this bowl is the origin of the cookie. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's continue the experiment to $t=2$. Now we reach over and grab another cookie. Again it is plain. Therefore we do the update again, based on the fact that we found the posterior for P(B1|plain):\n",
    "\n",
    "$P_{t=2}(B1|plain) = \\dfrac{0.75 \\times 0.6}{0.75 \\times 0.6 + 0.25} = 0.64$\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, this posterior becomes the new prior for the next update $t=3$. **Note that the likelihoods are NOT probability functions and they do not change between steps!!**\n",
    "\n",
    "### QUIZ (important):\n",
    "\n",
    "What would the update be if we pulled a chocolate cookie? Recall that we are updating $P(B1)$"

    "Here I have constructed for you a simulation of coin flips, representing the prior in full as a distribution over the entire probability space $0 < P(heads) < 1$. Thus in this case, each subdivision $i$ of the probability space counts as a single model of $M_{i} = P(heads) = p_{i}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we don't know if the coin we are flipping is fair. Say we know nothing about it. We can construct a probability table that reflects a continuum of hypotheses about the probability $p(H)$, ranging from 0 to 1. Note that the probability we will give tails is $1-p(H)$. This probability table then represents the probability distribution of the prior hypothesis, and we update it as above.\n",
