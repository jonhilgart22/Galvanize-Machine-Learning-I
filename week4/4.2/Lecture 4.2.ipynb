    "Naive Bayes is one of the simpler supervised techniques; a little more complex than simple regressions and kNN (and sometimes is criticized for its naivete). It has found a nice home in the domain of text processing and document information retrieval. Today we will discuss how the algorithm works, how to use it, and why it works so well for text data.\n",

    "Why Text?\n",
    ">Why has Naive Bayes come to be used somewhat exclusively for text (although any labeled data will do). Well... text data happens to fit very nicely to the bullet points of Where/When to use Naive Bayes. Due to bag of words featurization of text, the input feature matrix is often very wide (~10,000 - 50,000 columns/dimensions) and can even be greater than the number of data samples (n << p).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Also, we often encounter in the text classification problem the need for multiple classes. We have the text of articles/documents and would like to classify the article to its appropriate topic/categorization (e.g. sports, politics, arts, etc.).\n",

    "Take a moment to think of how absurd this is. A document that contains the word \"soccer\" is probably more likely to contain the word \"ball\" than an average document. We assume that this is not true! But it turns out that this assumption doesn't hurt us too much and we still have a lot of predictive power. But the probabilities that we end up with are not at all true probabilities. We can only use them to compare which of the classes is the most likely.\n",

Naive Bayes technically can be traced back to the formulation of Bayes Theorem, but it was first extensively studied as a supervised classifier in the 1960s.\n",

    "Let us think about the problem of spam... If you are Google, you have millions of users who receive emails daily. But the pattern of email is quite particular as compared to other datasets: a user receives a single email at a time and before you (Google) pass the email to their inbox you need to determine at that immediate moment whether or not it is spam. So why not another classifier?\n",

    "Train fast on all of your data... or incrementally update (the stream of emails is not stopping anytime soon)\n",
