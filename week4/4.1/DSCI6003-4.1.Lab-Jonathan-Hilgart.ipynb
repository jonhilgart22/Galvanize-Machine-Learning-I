    "#### 5: Treating the data with a model\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we're ready to try to fit our data with Logistic Regression and today evaluate it with a ROC curve.  Remember the following from earlier in class and use sklearn to fit a logisitc regression again:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Use sklearn's [KFold cross validation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cross_validation.KFold.html) and [LinearRegression](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html) to calculate the average accuracy, precision and recall.\n",

    "        Hint: Use sklearn's implementation of these scores in [sklearn.metrics](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.metrics).\n",
    "\n",
    "    * The `rank` column is numerical, but as it has 4 buckets, we could also consider it to be categorical. Use panda's [get_dummies](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.core.reshape.get_dummies.html) to binarize the column.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Make a plot of the ROC curve (using your function defined in Part 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Is it possible to pick a threshold where TPR > 60% and FPR < 40%? What is the threshold?\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Note that even if it appears to be in the middle of the graph it doesn't make the threshold 0.5.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6: Using the Youden Index\n",
    "\n",
    "Youden's Index (sometimes called J statistic) is similar to the F1 score in that it is a single number that describes the performance of a classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$J = Sensitivity + Specificity - 1$$\n",

    "* 0 indicating that the classifier does no better than random\n",
    "* 1 indicating that the test performed perfectly\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be thought of as an improvement on the F1 score since it takes into account all of the cells in a confusion matrix.  It can also be used to find the optimal threshold for a given ROC curve."
