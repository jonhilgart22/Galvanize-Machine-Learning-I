    "\n",
    "The development of a new machine learning model always seems to happen in concert with its cost (or \"objective\" or \"loss\") function. This is often due to the fact that the optimization (as opposed to tuning) of an algorithm is by far the hardest part of getting it to work for you. The process of choosing the algorithm you hope to use to optimize is directly related to the nature of the cost function. This makes the cost function, and understanding how you go about getting it, one of the most important aspects to understanding machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture we will revisit this topic both in more depth and generality. In particular we focus on the problem of obtaining a parameter $\\theta$ for a model given a set of experimental observations, $X$.\n",

    "\n",
    "The method-of-moments (MOM), often most correctly known as the GMM or generalized method-of-moments, is a way of getting an estimate for a model parameter when there too difficult to conduct a likelihood (probabilistic) analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "GMM is an estimator constructed on minimal assumptions, (e.g. the BLUE conditions) making it possible to use in cases where we know very little about the data itself. It is relatively common in econometrics where the system under study is so large and relationships within are so vague as to render standard assumptions impossible."
