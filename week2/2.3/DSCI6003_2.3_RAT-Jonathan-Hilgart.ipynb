    ">KNN is a method to classify test data points from a training set of data. You set the K, which determines the number of 'neighbors' that are used to predict which point the test data should belong to. Each 'neighborhood' consists of K 'neighbors' which are the closest points to your test data point. 'Closest' here could be a number of different distance metrics (Euclidean, Mahalanobis, Cosine ...etc).  Finally, to determine the classifications of your test points' neighborhood, you find the most common label and predict that the test data point will belong to that classification. "
