    "\n",
    "We have already discussed clustering in a casual context. Most of the algorithms that you have learned so far are **supervised algorithms** in that all the training data is *labeled*. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the label is the supervisor! There is a way of dealing with data that is **not** labeled beforehand. This is clustering. It is the only method of **unsupervised learning**, and the moniker of \"clustering\" encompasses a vast array of complex algorithms designed to extract signal from data without knowing what the signal looks like beforehand.\n",

    "This has already come up - I.E. what happens if we need to build a model and there are no labels? \n",
    "\n",
    "This can happen if:\n",
    "1. No labels have been provided and you need to set up an initial classifier based on the presumption of finite classes.\n",
    "2. You are looking to determine if continuous data can be grouped into finite classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both of these cases, you need to cluster the data. \n",

    "To be precise: Clustering is to divide data into groups (label) wherein all observations within each group meet a certain standard of similarity. \n",

We typically report a tree with a **cut** at a given height. Note that the height gives some sense of separation between clusters, along with their geometry. Choosing this height is, however, is a matter of great interest (just as k is above) and will be discussed as above in the next lecture."
