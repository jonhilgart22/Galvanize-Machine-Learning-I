    "- 1) Kmeans is a method of find clusters of data. The way it works is you first initialize k number of centers of clusters (at random), then you go through the data and compute center that is closest to each data point and assign a label to each data point. Then, you compute the new center of the labeled data, find the closest points to that new center and repeat a set number of times.\n",
    "- KMeans produces non-deterministic results because it may find the local solution but not the maximum solution. This is because the centers of the cluster are initialized at random and therefore may be only a local minimum at the end of the iterations.\n",
    "- KMeans++ is a method for finding better potential centers of the clusters. The way it works is you initialize a random point (as your first center), and then you calculate the distance of every other data point to this initial center. Translate the distance into probability ( higher distance = more probability) and then pick the next cetner. This is used in an attempt to spread out the centers throughout the data to find a solution closer to the global maximum."
